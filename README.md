# ec2_create_script
About: 

Script used to create an ec2 instance, keypair and security group at a very basic level. You can include different aws cli commands to make this script unique to you. 

--------------

Intro: 

Prior to starting you will need to have an authenticated user/role that has AWS CLI access with the appropriate permissions to create/delete keypairs/security groups/ec2 instances. If your user/role does not have these permissions the script will fail.
